This Android app is for the PDIoT course. It connects to a Nordic Thingy52 and logs acceleration and gyroscope data to a CSV file. There is also a user interface to tag the data with additional information such as your group letter and type of walking. You are free to modify the app to implement your own step counting algorithm and Android user interface.
